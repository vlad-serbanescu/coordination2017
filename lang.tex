\section{ABS Language Concepts}
- the main concepts: async calls, await on boolean and futures, each object has its own queue.
- example for coroutines (Paul Klint paper at SEN)

\subsection{Proof of Concept: Actor-based implementation of Agent-based modelling}
-expressive generic agent model \\
-software engineering context \\
- support for functional data types, FLI, type-checking\\
-sequence of events that maximize agent throughput\\
