\section{Conclusions}
We have a java library
We have already benchmarked overhead, but we want to use it for real case studies auctioning and incremental evaluation of railway systems
Promising candidate fo a basis for industrial adoption of the ABS language.
Advantage 
ABS is a rich language with this backend because of the formal analysis, resource analysis and deadlock detection.
Fromally defined language which provides the use of FA. 
Extensions for real-time programming and distributed programming.  
Scala backend for ABS have a full implementation of the functional data types (auctioning system)
