\section{Introduction}

The Actor-based model of computation is particularly tailored to the description
of distributed systems.  Actors interact via the asynchronous communication of messages.
Messages in general are queued and processed in a run-to-completion mode of execution.


-high-level description of cooperative scheduling\\
-position the paper with scala and Akka, state of the art\\
- problem statement: how stacks need to be saved in OO, how expensive a thread is\\
- strongly typed actors messages.
- the scope of the paper is implementation in the Java Runtime Environment/Java Virtual MAchine(JVM)
- using ABS as a mute programming language, real software development context, support for object-oriented design and foreign lanuage interface.
