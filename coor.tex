\begin{abstract}
Modeling applications at the design phase of any project is highly important in order to build a reliable, fast and robust system. Understanding the control flow of execution from just the model is crucial for the applications next software engineering phases such as implementation, testing, release and maintenance.  If we add that a large portion software systems are running several jobs in parallel, with a good model we can observe data consistency and detect deadlocks efficiently. One of the toughest models to execute, especially in a parallel or distributed environment is the Actor-based model which introduces the notion of cooperative scheduling, a high-level synchronization mechanism which allows an actor to continue to execute messages from its queue when the current message execution is suspended . In this paper we will investigate some of the challenges of translating the cooperative scheduling behavior into the Java Runtime Environment. We will analyze the Abstract Behavioral Specification (ABS) Language concepts which are very well suited for Agent-based applications modeling and provide a benchmark for testing several solutions of efficiently running cooperative scheduling behavior.
